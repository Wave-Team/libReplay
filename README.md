# libReplay
A high-level replay framework for NetherGames. API `1.0` - Codename: Underdog.

### PHP Requirements:
- PHP 7.3 ZTS (only version we're supporting)
- php-ext-zstd (0.8.0)

### About:
This framework is meant to be used on NetherGames Production Servers. Hence, the
main goal is to provide a performance-optimized framework. The framework relies
heavily on more than just its code-base. It's not meant to be a stand-alone.

This project was originally inspired by Tobias. His aim was to provide an entry
based system that would record data monitored by the server. 

### Features:
- Recording:
    - Movement (only Player)
    - Damage
    - Health
    - Inventory (only visual changes)
    - Animations (Block placing/breaking, attacking, eating)
    - Block placing/breaking
    - Chest opening/closing
    - Effects
- Replaying:
    - Movement (only Player)
    - Damage
    - Health
    - Inventory (only visual changes)
    - Animations (Block placing/breaking, attacking, eating)
    - Block placing/breaking
    - Chest opening/closing
    - Effects
    
This framework aims to record every single moment with as much accuracy as
possible. The current features are as of API `1.0`. 

### Why open-source?
Open-source has always been an adventure. We have faith in the community that
credit will be given to us where due. Knowledge is meant to be shared and we hope
to have this project serves as a basis for other cool projects done by the community.

Furthermore, open-source has its benefits. We want the project to be able to benefit
from the entire community's knowledge in making it better. This project is
meant to not only be a NetherGames team effort but a community effort too.

For this very reason, we accept contributions to the project through PRs or overall
management. Help in managing the ideas, providing solutions to issues, and anything
you can. **NOTE: Due to maintaining high code standards, the PRs must adhere to
strict guidelines.**

## Documentation

### Basic Definitions

Before you start writing code depending on the framework, it's expected to know the 
difference between `external` and `internal`. `internal` classes/interfaces have 
been flagged specifically in the class documentation with the `@internal` tag. Any
class not having an `@internal` tag is assumed (and defined) to be `external`.

##### What does `internal` & `external` mean?
`internal` means this class/interface isn't supposed to be constructed outside 
`libReplay` and that its static/non-static methods are not meant to be called 
outside `libReplay`.

`external` means you may construct the class/interface outside of `libReplay` and 
its static/non-static methods may be used outside `libReplay`.

Due to the lack of package-specific visibility in `PHP 7.3`, we must resort to this
to ensure the high standards of the framework.

#### Starting
    
To begin with, you must `setup()` the `\libReplay\ReplayServer`. This can be done at 
startup very simply by adding `\libReplay\ReplayServer::setup(<PluginBase>)` to 
your code.
    
#### Making a server

Not to confuse with setup, "making a server" is a runtime-based thing. The
server is just the level and a bunch of connected clients. Only the connected
clients are recorded. This can be done very simply too:
```php
$playerListToRecord = array<Player>;
$replayServer = new \libReplay\ReplayServer($playerListToRecord, <RecordedLevel>);
```
That's all. Simple.
    
#### Start/Stop/Monitor recording

Like the previous steps, thanks to the high-level API, you can start recording
simply by:
```php
/** @var \libReplay\ReplayServer $replayServer */
$replayServer->toggleRecord();
```
and to stop, you just run it again.

You can also check if it's recording like so:
```php
/** @var \libReplay\ReplayServer $replayServer */
$replayServer->isRecording();
```
If it was recording, you can specify optional arguments for 
`ReplayServer::toggleRecord()` to save the recording allowing you to later on
save to a file or database. These optional arguments are:
```php
/** @var \libReplay\ReplayServer $replayServer */
$replayServer->toggleRecord(saveRecording: true, extraSaveData: []);
```
**Note: These optional arguments are only used if the recording is being
stopped. Furthermore, `recordingName` is only used if `saveRecording` is set
to `true`. Extra save data is so you can save confirmation/other types of data
for verification and handling.**
    
#### Saving/Loading a replay

The framework is designed for saving replays exceptionally well without data
corruption. The format is based of Zstandard rules and regulations. Anyhow, the high-level API
provides a method-based wrapper to ensure we can get a save-able replay very
easily. The `\libReplay\event\ReplayComposedEvent` is called when a replay has finished being
compressed. You can fetch the data from that event and save a replay.

To load a replay after getting replay data back (This is not multi-threaded):
```php
$replayCompressed = new \libReplay\data\ReplayCompressed(memory: '');
$replay = $replayCompressed->decompress();
```

#### Playing a replay

The framework is designed to play a replay in `object` form. Straight up
compressed strings/file cannot be played. However, you can convert compressed
replay-based strings to a `libReplay\data\Replay` object. Furthermore, in the event
of one replay(ing) session encountering a corruption, it ensures the other sessions
are handled on their own independently.

To play a replay, you must create a new `libReplay\ReplayViewer`. This viewer,
views (plays) the replay. You can play a replay easily like so:
```php
/** @var \libReplay\data\Replay $replay */
/** @var \pocketmine\level\Level $level */
/** @var \libReplay\ReplayViewer $replayViewer */
$replayViewer = new \libReplay\ReplayViewer($replay, $level);
$replayViewer->play();
```

Loading the level and teleporting the players is not the framework's responsibility.
